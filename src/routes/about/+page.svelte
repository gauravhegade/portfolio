<h1>About Gaurav Hegade</h1>
<p>
  Hello, I am a developer from India with a focus on Linux, System
  Administration, and Cloud Architecture Development and Deployment. My journey
  in the world of technology has led me to explore a diverse range of areas, and
  I'm excited to share a bit about my expertise and interests. Linux has always
  held a special place in my heart. The open-source nature of the Linux
  operating system and the customization and automation it offers have always
  fascinated me. In the web development domain, I have been working on building
  applications with Svelte and SvelteKit. I like their reactive and
  component-based approach to building web applications. Furthermore, I have a
  quite decent grasp in Python, having worked with popular web frameworks like
  Django and Flask.
