<h1>About Gaurav Hegade</h1>
<p>
    Hello, I am a developer from India with a focus on Linux, System
    Administration, and Cloud Engineering. My journey in
    the world of technology has led me to explore a wide range of technical
    domains, and I'm excited to share a bit about my expertise and interests.
    <!-- Linux has always held a special place in my heart. The open-source nature of
    the Linux operating system and the customization and automation it offers
    have always fascinated me. In the web development domain, I have been
    working on building applications with Svelte and SvelteKit. I like their
    reactive and component-based approach to building web applications.
    Furthermore, I have a quite decent grasp in Python, having worked with
    popular web frameworks like Django and Flask. -->
